C++ source code for the 2023/4 rewrite.

Written with C++ Builder 11.3 Community Edition

WARNING: This code is early beta, work-in-progress, quite a lot of functionality, might crash.

FOR THE FORSEEABLE FUTURE:

If it's in this folder then it probably compiles, but use at your own risk. It's not finished and there are major bugs just waiting to be found.


For rewrite progress and other cool stuff (maybe even cat pictures), follow my new blog:

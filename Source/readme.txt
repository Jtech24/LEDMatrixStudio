C++ source code for the 2023/4 rewrite.

Written with C++ Builder 11.3 Community Edition

    https://www.embarcadero.com/products/cbuilder/starter

WARNING: This code is late alpha, early beta, work-in-progress, some functionality, probably crashes.

FOR THE FORSEEABLE FUTURE:

If it's in this folder then it probably compiles, but use at your own risk. It's not finished (by a long way) and there are major bugs just waiting to be found.


For rewrite progress and other cool stuff (maybe even cat pictures), follow my new blog:
